# term-bad-apple
Play bad apple on your terminal!

# Install
### Virtual environments
**Note: 'virtual environment' will be shortened to 'venv'. Also, make sure you activate it!**<br><br>
If you want or need to, you can set up a venv.<br>
Make sure you fix the shebang in `term-bad-apple.py` if you do, otherwise it will use the wrong interpreter.

### Dependencies
You need to install the dependencies.<br>Run the command:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Run
Just run the command:
```shell
./term-bad-apple.py
```
to run bad apple on your terminal!
<br><br>

**Note: If this error occurrs: `bash: ./term-bad-apple.py: Permission denied`, run:**
```shell
chmod +x term-bad-apple.py
```
**then run the program.**

# Just note...
You do need a Linux system to use this. You may create ports for it, though!
And, yes, I do know there are other shells then bash like zsh or fish. Hopefully this guide works for you
aswell!
